# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This webpage was developed to demonstrate my knowledge of thirdparty APIs, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap. It allows users to search by city and get the current weather and forecast for the next 5 days. The searches are saved on a local storage and displayed on the page so it is easier for the user to revisit.
